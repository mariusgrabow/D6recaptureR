# D6recaptureR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of D6recaptureR is to help us during swallow recapturing

## Installation

You can install the development version of D6recaptureR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mariusgrabow/D6recaptureR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to handle a recapture:

1. You need a dataframe named cmr (case-sensitive) from the last years (provided by Marius). Here, we will work with one example from one bird (included in the package)

Please note: In this example, cmr has 11 rows

```{r example}

library(D6recaptureR)

cmr<-D6recaptureR::cmr_filter
nrow(cmr)

```

Imagine you recaptured bird (VH59051) and would like to know the capture history:

(You can write vh59051 or VH59051, the package corrects to Uppercase)

```{r recapture}
re(vh59051)
```

Please note, cmr has 12 rows now (one was added with the System date & time)

```{r}
nrow(cmr)
```

Let's look at the last observation, which we just added. Here, there is data missing, although we might collected it manually on the field sheets. However, this should save us a lot of time because we don't have to screen a pile of paper.

```{r}
dplyr::slice_tail(cmr,n=1)
```
